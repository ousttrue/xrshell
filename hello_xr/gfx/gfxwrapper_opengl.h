Description  : Convenient wrapper for the OpenGL API.
Orig. Author : J.M.P. van Waveren
Orig. Date   : 12/21/2014
Language     : C99
Copyright    : Copyright (c) 2016 Oculus VR, LLC. All Rights reserved.
             : Portions copyright (c) 2016 The Brenwill Workshop Ltd. All Rights reserved.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

The code is written in an object-oriented style with a focus on minimizing state
and side effects. The majority of the functions manipulate self-contained objects
without modifying any global state (except for OpenGL state). The types
introduced in this file have no circular dependencies, and there are no forward
declarations.

Even though an object-oriented style is used, the code is written in straight C99 for
maximum portability and readability. To further improve portability and to simplify
compilation, all source code is in a single file without any dependencies on third-
party code or non-standard libraries. The code does not use an OpenGL loading library
like GLEE, GLEW, GL3W, or an OpenGL toolkit like GLUT, FreeGLUT, GLFW, etc. Instead,
the code provides direct access to window and context creation for driver extension work.

The code is written against version 4.3 of the Core Profile OpenGL Specification,
and version 3.1 of the OpenGL ES Specification.

Supported platforms are:

        - Microsoft Windows 7 or later
        - Ubuntu Linux 14.04 or later
        - Apple macOS 10.11 or later
        - Apple iOS 9.0 or later
        - Android 5.0 or later


GRAPHICS API WRAPPER
====================

The code wraps the OpenGL API with a convenient wrapper that takes care of a
lot of the OpenGL intricacies. This wrapper does not expose the full OpenGL API
but can be easily extended to support more features. Some of the current
limitations are:

- The wrapper is setup for forward rendering with a single render pass. This
  can be easily extended if more complex rendering algorithms are desired.

- A pipeline can only use 256 bytes worth of plain integer and floating-point
  uniforms, including vectors and matrices. If more uniforms are needed then
  it is advised to use a uniform buffer, which is the preferred approach for
  exposing large amounts of data anyway.

- Graphics programs currently consist of only a vertex and fragment shader.
  This can be easily extended if there is a need for geometry shaders etc.


KNOWN ISSUES
============

OS     : Apple Mac OS X 10.9.5
GPU    : Geforce GT 750M
DRIVER : NVIDIA 310.40.55b01
-----------------------------------------------
- glGetQueryObjectui64v( query, GL_QUERY_RESULT, &time ) always returns zero for a timer query.
- glFlush() after a glFenceSync() stalls the CPU for many milliseconds.
- Creating a context fails when the share context is current on another thread.

OS     : Android 6.0.1
GPU    : Adreno (TM) 530
DRIVER : OpenGL ES 3.1 V@145.0
-----------------------------------------------
- Enabling OVR_multiview hangs the GPU.


WORK ITEMS
==========

- Implement WGL, GLX and NSOpenGL equivalents of EGL_IMG_context_priority.
- Implement an extension that provides accurate display refresh timing (WGL_NV_delay_before_swap, D3DKMTGetScanLine).
- Implement an OpenGL extension that allows rendering directly to the front buffer.
- Implement an OpenGL extension that allows a compute shader to directly write to the front/back buffer images
(WGL_AMDX_drawable_view).
- Improve GPU task switching granularity.
